    <h2>Let's start slow with a simple overall sales graph</h2>
    <div id="container1"></div>
    <p>
        This graph starts us off with a very general trend about the overall sales in McDonalds.
        Starting from 2016 up until the beginning of Q4 2018, we have had a good steady rise in sales. 
        October of 2018 marks a large drop in sales bringing us to our first main concern: Burger King. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>The Effect of the Impossible Burger</h2>
    <p>
        To really see how Burger King's 2018 'Impossible Burger' affected our overall sales, let's look 
        at our monthly change in sales leading up to and around October of 2018. 
    </p>
    <div id="container2"></div>
    <div id="container3"></div>
    <p>
        From the diff chart, we can see that the October 2018 was by far the largest drop in performance
        that we have had in the last 3 years. The drop in sales was over double the previous largest drop.
        A whopping -847,313 previous minimum turned into -1,873,234 dollar difference. From the 
        chart of z-scores, we see this point has a z-score of -3.5, a <b>huge outlier</b> in our data. 
        <br><br>
        
        In addition, 
        our total sales after the month of October 2018 has stagnated for the entireity of 2019 rather than 
        following our previous growth before 2018. We can assume that there is something about the 'Impossible 
        Burger' that is helping Burger King keep our customers with them. If the burger only had hype, our 
        customers should be returning and we should see our numbers grow once again. 
        <br><br>
        
        After doing some research about the 'Impossible Burger,' it is understandable to see the excitement
        around it. I applaud them for being among the first of the large burger chains to release a burger
        without any beef in it! Burger King has taken advantage of the recent trend of Americans going 
        vegetarian in awareness of animal cruelty and simply being more health consious.
        <br><br>
        
        <b>Therefore, I propose that we do the same! Let us have McDonalds create our own vegetarian burger 
        that will both outdo the hype and the performance of Burger King's 'Impossible Burger.'</b> I am sure 
        that this will appeal to our current customers, our customers that have left for more health friendly 
        options, and health-consious customers that have never tried McDonalds before! 
        <br><br>
        
        What we will create and how we will advertise it? I will leave that to our development and marketing 
        teams. <b>I can assure you that the creation of a new vegetarian burger will blow Burger King out of the 
        water and we will see a huge spike in sales.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Regional Analysis</h2>
    <div id="container4"></div>
    <p>
        Looking at the total sales per region, North East sales are barely above the rest of the regions' sales. It is 
        not a significant enough difference to make any large conclusions however. 
    </p>

    <div id="container5"></div>
    <p>
        Looking at the sales of each item in their respective compared to their sales in other regions really does 
        does not give any insight about how different the regions are. Each food item is near equal in all regions 
        with hamburgers being the obvious money maker in every region. We can probably conclude that there are little 
        to no regional biases for any one food item.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Micro Analysis</h2>
    <div id="container6"></div>
    <p>
        We can also look at smaller portions of data (specifically January of 2016). I attempted to look at the days 
        of the week to see if there is any significant bias towards for McDonalds on any specific day of the week. 
        We cannot make any real conclusions however since the data is nearly even. We can see that there is a slight 
        increase of sales during the weekend compared to the weekdays by around 2%-3%. 
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        In conclusion, October of 2018 was a rough time for sales and that can be attributed to Burger King's 'Impossible 
        Burger'. The introduction of a direct competitor's new vegetarian burger directly affected McDonalds' overall sales 
        for that month and for the following months. Though our sales do not continue to decrease, they are stagnating. 
        In counter to their new burger, I propose that we should introduce our own vegetarian burger that will both retake 
        our customers that are looking for healthier alternatives as well as bring in new customers seeing quick, and 
        health consious food. 

        Looking at regional statistics, there seems to be little to no difference among the regions in regards to total and 
        individual item sales. Each region seems to follow the same trend of hamburgers distinctly at the very top while 
        fish and chicken fillets hold constant sales. 

        Looking at more daily statistics, few things can be said about sales within different days of the week. There is a 
        small difference in sales during the weekend in comparison to weekdays (around 2%-3%).
