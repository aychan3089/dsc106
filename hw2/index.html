    <h1>A Report on the sales of McDonalds</h1>
    <h2>Let's start slow with a simple overall sales graph</h2>

    <p>
        This graph starts us off with a very general trend about the overall sales in McDonalds.
        Starting from 2016 up until the beginning of Q4 2018, we have had a good steady rise in sales. 
        October of 2018 marks a large drop in sales bringing us to our first main concern: Burger King.

    <h2>The Effect of the Impossible Burger</h2>
    <p>
        To really see how Burger King's 2018 'Impossible Burger' affected our overall sales, let's look 
        at our monthly change in sales leading up to and around October of 2018.

    <div id="container8"></div>
    <p>
        From the diff chart, we can see that the October 2018 was by far the largest drop in performance
        that we have had in the last 3 years. The drop in sales was over double the previous largest drop.
        A whopping -847,313 previous minimum turned into -1,873,234 dollar difference. From the 
        chart of z-scores we can see that this is just a huge outlier in from our average data.
